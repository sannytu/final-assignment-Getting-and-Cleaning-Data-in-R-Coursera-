Final assignment - Cleaning and Getting Data course project code book

# Import data 

For the analysis I used :
  library(readr) 	-> to import and export the final result into txt file.
  library(dplyr)	-> to cleaning and wrangling the data

for this final task, I input several txt file. There are: 
  "x_train" 
  "y_train" 
  "x_test"
  "y_test" 
  "activity_labels"

# Analysis process

(1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

> names(activity_labels) <- c("Activity_code", "Activity_label")  # labelling name

> names(y_train) <- "Activity_code"                               # Naming variable in "y_train" 

> "train_data" <- data.frame(y_train, x_train)                    # merge "y_train" and "x_train"

> train_data <- merge(activity_labels, train_data, by = "Activity_code", all.y = TRUE)

> names(y_test) <- "Activity_code"                                # Naming variable in "y_test"

> "test_data" <- data.frame(y_test, x_test)                       # merge "y_test" and "x_test"

> test_data <- merge(activity_labels, test_data, by = "Activity_code", all.y = TRUE)

> "all_data" <- rbind(train_data, test_data)                      # merge train data and test data

(2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

"tidy_data" <- reshape2::dcast(data = all_data, all_data$Activity_code + all_data$Activity_label ~ ., fun.aggregate = mean)
names(tidy_data) <- c("Activity code", "Activity label", "Mean")

# Export data

write.table(tidy_data, file = "tidy_data.txt")
